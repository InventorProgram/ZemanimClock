# ZemanimClock

Jewish Halacha dictates that certain prayers be said at certain times, and adhering to these times is something very important for religious Jews. 

However, these times are dependent on solar time, meaning that the exact times depend on the rising and setting of the sun, so they fluctuate from day to day. 

In order to find these times, people use the internet and webstes like MyZemanim, but without internet access, these sites are inaccesible.

Introducing the Universal Zemanim Clock:

Using only the time and GPS location (lattitude and longitude), this esp32 device calculates sunrise, sunset, and solar noon, and from there, determines some of the most important Jewish prayer times. 

The Universal Zemanim Clock calculates zemain for the ease of use for Tefilah times and many other times as required by Halacha.
